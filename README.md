# RSS Get Userscript

This is from my personal old project which is hosted on google code [http://code.google.com/p/rssget/]

It's a user scripts for retrieve full content for google reader (no bloglines now, sorry).
The supported is limited to a couple of sites e.g. hk.news.yahoo.com, based on a simple selector settings.
The script work on either Firefox (with greasemonkey) and Google Chrome.

I have refactored most of old code to make use of the newer js feature browser can provide now. 
Also provided with a test.
