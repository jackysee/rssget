# RSS Get Userscript

This is from my personal old project which is hosted on [google code](http://code.google.com/p/rssget/)

It's a user scripts for retrieve full content for google reader (no bloglines now, sorry).
The supported is limited to a couple of sites e.g. hk.news.yahoo.com, based on a simple selector settings.
The script work on either Firefox (with [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-tw/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) ) and Google Chrome (with [blank canvas scripts handler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pipnnjjknlabchljabhmnpdfpdobpnkk?hl=zh-TW)).

I have refactored most of old code to make use of the newer js feature browser can provide now. 
Also provided with a test.
